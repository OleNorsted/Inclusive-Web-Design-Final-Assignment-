                <h4 class="underHeadline">Tackling the climate problem is not easy.</h4>
                <p>The problem becomes more apparent year after year, as we see more extreme weather, melting of the
                    poles and deserts becoming larger.
                    These alarming consequences of climate change can traced back to human behavior, and a lack of
                    unsustainable habits as simple as eating <a

                All of us are encouraged to reduce our ecological footprint.
                We pressure politicians into making changes for the better, donate to various climate change causes
                and most countries have become incredibly good at recycling.
                What most if not all of us have in common though, is that we like to eat.
                Most people do not know that methane has a global warming potential, 86 times greater than that of
                CO2 on a year time frame.
                And what makes up for much of the planet's methane production?

                <h4 class="underHeadline">The climate problem is not new.</h4>
                <p>In today’s age we’re surrounded by articles discussing the possible end of civilization as we know it due to climate changes. 
                    While the average person might say that they care about climate changes, their actions may speak differently. 
                    It’s difficult for people to change their lifestyle choices in hopes of stopping climate change due to the lack of time and resources. 
                    The lack of diverse meals that cut out foods that help increase the speed of climate changes makes it difficult for people to make full healthy meals that taste good while saving the planet. 
                    We believe in creating recipes that dabble in different types of diets is an easy way for people to cut down on their emissions while providing healthy meals.</p>
                <br>
                <h4 class="underHeadline"> The apps main goal is information.</h4>
                <p> We see that info about non-meat options are scarce and difficult to find.
                    Thats why our ambition is to give people the option to share their info, catalogue their progress.
                    This will, inspire others to be creative towards the subtle art of food.</p>
