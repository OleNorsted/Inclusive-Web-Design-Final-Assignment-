                    Inspired by the UN’s 13th sustainable development goal. Our ambition is to make it easier for consumers to transition into more sustainable and healthier eating-habits. 
                </p>
                <p>The Challenge:
                    “appnavn” faces a variety of problems and concerns in regards to climate change:
                    1.	Sustainable agriculture, forestry, and water use.
                    2.	Being climate-friendly requires a lifestyle change.
                    3.	Lack of information and guidance.
                    4.	Contribution is not visible.
                    5.	A bad reputation among ordinary consumers.
                    
                    Tackling a worldwide problem like climate change is not easy. The problem becomes more apparent year after year, as we see more extreme weather, melting of the poles and deserts becoming larger. 
                    These alarming consequences of climate change can be directly traced back to human behaviour, and a lack of unsustainable habits as simple as eating.

                    All of us are encouraged to reduce our ecological footprint on the planet. 
                    We pressure politicians into making changes for the better, donate to various climate change causes and most countries have become incredibly good at recycling. 
                    What most if not all of us have in common though, is that we really, really like to eat. 
                    Most people do not know that methane has a global warming potential, 86 times greater than that of CO2 on a year time frame. 
                    And what makes up for much of the planet’s methane production? Agriculture.
