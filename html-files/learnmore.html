                <h4 class="underHeadline">Tackling the climate problem is not easy.</h4>

                <p>The problem becomes more apparent year after year, as we see more extreme weather, melting of the
                    poles and deserts becoming larger.
                    These alarming consequences of climate change can traced back to human behavior, and a lack of
                    unsustainable habits as simple as eating <a

                    All of us are encouraged to reduce our ecological footprint.
                    We pressure politicians into making changes in the community, donate to various climate change
                    causes
                    and recycling has become a bigger part of society than ever before.
                    What most if not all of us have in common though, is that we like to eat.
                    As global food production rises at the same rate as the population, so too does methane gas
                    production.
                    This gas has a global warming potential of 86 times greater than that of carbon dioxide on a
                    yearly
                    time frame.
                    And what makes up for much of the planet's methane production? Agriculture

                <h4 class="underHeadline">The climate problem is not new.</h4>
                <p>In today’s age we’re surrounded by articles discussing the possible end of civilization as we
                    know it
                    due to climate changes.
                    While the average person might say that they care about climate changes, their actions may speak
                    differently.
                    It’s difficult for people to change their lifestyle choices in hopes of stopping climate change
                    due
                    to the lack of time and resources.
                    The lack of diverse meals that cut out foods that help increase the speed of climate changes
                    makes
                    it difficult for people to make full healthy meals that taste good while saving the planet

                        class="footnote" target="_blank">[4]</a>.
                    We believe in creating recipes that dabble in different types of diets is an easy way for people
                    to
                    cut down on their emissions while providing healthy meals.</p>

                <h4 class="underHeadline"> Our main goals are to bring information and inspiring small changes.</h4>
                <p> We see that info about non-meat options are scarce and difficult to find.
                    Thats why our ambition is to give people the option to share their info, catalogue their
                    progress.
                    This will inspire others to be creative and open towards the subtle art of food.
