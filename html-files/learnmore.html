                </div>
                   <p>Tackling the climate problem is not easy. 
                    The problem becomes more apparent year after year, as we see more extreme weather, melting of the poles and deserts becoming larger. 
                    These alarming consequences of climate change can traced back to human behavior, and a lack of unsustainable habits as simple as eating.<a href=""></a>

                    All of us are encouraged to reduce our ecological footprint on the planet. 
                    We pressure politicians into making changes for the better, donate to various climate change causes and most countries have become incredibly good at recycling.
                    What most if not all of us have in common though, is that we like to eat. 
                    Most people do not know that methane has a global warming potential, 86 times greater than that of CO2 on a year time frame.
                    And what makes up for much of the planet's methane production?

                <h2 class="Headline"> The Social Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    The climate problem is not new. We see it everywhere in media and society.

“The end of civilization”-articles and the like are impossible to ignore, and you should not ignore it either. 
Yet, we are not only facing climate change itself. 
The average person does not want, and or does not have time and resources to dedicate themselves towards climate change.
 They are also way less likely to change their way of eating for it. 
 The main excuses for not changing to a more eco friendly lifestyle is because it takes too much prepping. 
 Other reasons are that the variety of recipes are low and not diverse enough. 
 The root cause of this misinformation between consumers, are often acts extreme veganism that often distracts from the benefits of it.
External forces (media, roles in society, social networks) are very important aspects of society that often hinders ordinary consumers to take the conscious step towards a better tomorrow. 
So when the main part of society seems focused on difficult and far-fetched solutions like hydrogen-cars, complex options of travel and expensive solar-panel plans, the average consumer is at a loss for options and tasks that can help turn the tide of climate change. That is where “appnavn” comes in. 
The apps main goal is information. 
We see that info about non-meat options are scarce and difficult to find. 
Thats why our ambition is to give people the option to share their info, catalogue their progress. 
This will, inspire others to be creative towards the subtle art of food.
